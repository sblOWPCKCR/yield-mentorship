# Task
Using [Paul R Berg excellent solidity template](https://github.com/paulrberg/solidity-template), code a registry inspired by the [Hashmasks name registry](https://www.thehashmasks.com/names), but with some changes to make it easier.

    Users (identified by an address) can claim a name, which is recorded on-chain.
    Once a name has been claimed, no other user can claim it.
    A name owner can release a name.
    An user can claim any number of names.

The contract should be fully tested ([example](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yield-utils-v2/blob/main/test/002_erc20.ts)), deployed on the Kovan testnet (example TBA), and verified in Etherscan (example TBA).
