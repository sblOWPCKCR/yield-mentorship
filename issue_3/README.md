# Task

A Vault that inherits from ERC20.

When the users deposit Token (another ERC20) they receive Vault tokens in the same amount.

To recover their initial Token, the users must burn the Vault tokens they originally received.

When done, have a look at [WETH9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code).
